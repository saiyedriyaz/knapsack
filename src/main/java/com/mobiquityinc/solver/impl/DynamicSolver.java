/**
 * This class solves the 1/0 knapsack problem with dynamic programming method. Dynamic programming requires an optimal substructure
 * and overlapping sub problems. 1 represent included item (whole) while 0 represent not included item.
 *
 * <p>
 * Algorithm:
 * If  (Item weight > capacity),
 * Then We cannot pick the item  In this case and max value will remain same as value we got in previous step without working on this item.
 * <p>
 * If  (Item weight <=  capacity),
 * Here we have 2 options, either we pick the item or we donâ€™t, based on the value we get by these two options
 * If value of picking the item is more, then we pick else we leave the item and value will be same as of our previous step
 * <p>
 * Steps :
 * 1.   Create a matrix representing all subsets of the items (the solution space) with rows representing items
 * and columns representing the bag's remaining weight capacity
 * 2.   Loop through the matrix and calculate the value that can be obtained by each combination of items at each stage of the bag's capacity.
 * 3.   Examine the completed matrix to determine which items to add to the bag in order to produce the maximum possible worth for the bag in total
